encapsulates SCSI commands and assembles the data in packets for the TCP/IP layer. Packets are sent over the network using a point-to-point connection. Upon arrival, the iSCSI protocol disassembles the packets, separating the SCSI commands, so the operating system (OS) will see the storage as a local SCSI device that can be formatted as usual. Technology: iSCSI network.

sequence of tokens forms a valid sentence given the definition of our grammar. The parser will read the source program and construct an Abstract Syntax Tree. If no syntax errors are encountered, the code will print the completed parse tree as flat text. In the Semantic Analysis Phase we write appropriate rules to check for type checking. Further we write appropriate
rules in Parser to generate Three Address Code. Elimination of Dead code and implementation of Common sub expression elimination takes place in the Intermediate Code Optimization Phase.

Company’s Name: Invenzo Labs India Pvt Ltd.
About The Company: Invenzo Labs based in Bengaluru, aims at
democratizing access to business critical technologies through SaaS platforms
to transform businesses, the way they run and achieve a holistic Digital
process Automation. The company has 3 Saas platforms:
1. Izowhiz : An intelligent Dispatch Platform
2. Izoleap : Digital Process Automation Platform
3. Izohealth : Ambulatory Service with EHR Mobility.
Skills Learnt: During this period I learnt to design the front end of
websites using Ajax, JQuery and JavaScript.
As Izoleap has partnered with Dunzo for the delivery of items, so my task
was to code public APIs for integrating Dunzo’s logistics network into our
application. Development of the APIs was done in Codeigniter which is based
on MVC.
For security purpose, Dunzo shares a unique client id and client secret with
each client. So the client will need to generate an access token to pass in the
request header for all the APIs. The Dunzo API uses HTTP status code to
indicate the status of our requests such as 200, 201, 304, 400, 401 etc.
Responses from the Dunzo APIs are in JSON format. If something goes
wrong, we get the error responses, which includes details about what went wrong.
APIs were developed to quote the price and pickup/dropoff eta estimate for a potential delivery based on query parameters like pickup latitude, pickup longitude, drop latitude and drop longitude.
Next API was to create a task on the Dunzo platform with the following POST
]##Internship_2:[Internship_2_Company@@Internship_2_ parameters : request_id, pickup_details, drop_details, sender_details,
receiver_details, special_instructions etc.
APIs are developed to track the status of the task such as created, queued,
runner_cancelled, runner_accepted, delivered etc.
All the responses from the APIs are decoded and stored in the database.

Web Technology Project
A website was hosted on the local machine which basically had a catalogue of games
and movies and some related information about it. All the users had to create an
account and then choose some games and movies that they like and we provide similar
recommendations to them based on the user data available to us of others which are
similar to current users.]##Project_3:[Project_3_Domain@@Project_3_  Mirai Botnet and Network Traffic Analysis| CCBD
Currently working and analysing the working of mirai botnet which is used for DDoS
attack and determining the attacks and network traffic generated by the mirai botnet.]##Project_4:[Project_4_Domain@@Project_4_ Mini-Compiler for C language | Compiler Design Project
A Mini compiler for C language was created which had all basic stages like analysis
part which checks for syntax of the code and Intermediate Code generation (TAC)
code, optimisation of code and finally generating the assembly code with machine
dependent optimisation. This was done for if , while and for loop constructs of the C
language along with basic data definition and declaration. ]##Project_5:[Project_5_Domain@@Project_5_ Micro-services using REST API,Containers and Dockers
Using Dockers,Containers and REST api’s a page called selfieless acts was created
which was like Facebook where users could post their good deeds and others could
comment on it and like the post as well. Mongodb was used as the database and flask
was used to run the script on the backend.All the work was done on amazon EC2
instances which is cloud computing.

Match Simulation Using Decision Tree and Probability.
our goal to simulate the ipl matches and check with original results how accurate our model is with both traditional and big data approach and compare the results.Show which approach is good.
− 1)Using Probability
Simulating a match ball by ball using Probability Statistics
K-Means clustering is applied to batsmen statistics .10 Clusters for batsmen were created to resemble 10
batting positions .5 Clusters for bowlers were created .From the player vs player statistics a probability
list of possible runs is created .Cumulative frequency is computed for the probability list and a run is
obtained by checking the interval that a random number generated between 0 and 1 falls into .Each
batsman is given a certain confidence score between 0 and 100 .The confidence score of a batsman
implies the probability of him not getting out . The confidence score of a bowler implies the probability of
him bowling a wicket taking ball .
− 2)Using Decision Tree
Simulating a match over by over with the help of Decision Tree
Used pyspark.ml.classification to import the DecisionTreeClassifier.
We convert the data to SPARK DataFrames and then train the DecisionTreeClassifier by fitting the data
consisting of 2016 IPL over by over statistics.
- For the predictions we pass the Batting Lineup,Bowling Order and the corresponding values of the features specified above.
- We are predicting the scores over by over.
- Our predictions return (RUNS,WICKETS) in that OVER.

(Feb 2019- May 2019)
Most continuous-speech recognition and generation systems are based on
phonemes and thus need phonetic transcription for words. Therefore, we
are in need of an automatic system that generates these transcriptions
from written words. Our project is to feature an approach to do machine
translation of words to phonetics, in standard
ARPAbet format. We used an RNN based LSTM model to accomplish this
task and tried improvising by adding different means of word embedding
and attention layer etc.

Short-answer questions can target learning goals more effectively than
multiple choice as they eliminate test-taking shortcuts like eliminating
improbable answers. We start in this project by tackling the simplest
problem where we attempt to make a machine learning based system
which would automatically grade one-line answers based on the given
reference answers.

This project is a part of our research internship in Cloud Computing and
Big Data, PES University. Cloud Sim is well-known framework and
simulation tool for cloud environment. Testing was limited to very few
granular elements from the real-life data centers. It supported only Data
centers servers and applications. The extended version of the simulation
model written in Java is a framework that supports a clear configurable
file to test various granular level. There has also been an inclusion made
to the Vm allocation policy keeping in mind the copies of an application
and failure zones if any.

This project aims to Detect, isolate and find the number of different colored cars on Bengaluru’s
roads. A caffe implementation of MobileNet-SSD detection network, with pre-trained weights was
used for detecting car which uses Deep Neural Network. OpenCV and K-Means Clustering was

Built an AI for Self-Driving Car by implementing Deep Q-Learning Model. This is a modelled version
of car in which car figures everything on its own, without any rules given it to how to operate in the
GUI environment with mazes beforehand. The states of the environment are encoded by a vector
which is passed as input into the Neural Network. Then the Neural Network will try to predict which
action should be played, by returning as outputs a Q-value for each of the possible actions.
Eventually, the best action to play is chosen by either taking the one that has the highest Q-value,
or by overlaying a Softmax function.

#### Very Simple File System: A simple and efficient file system built using C. FUSE library
was used to provide the interface between the linux commands and the user defined code.
Implemented simple file system calls like read, write, create, open and delete files and folders. Directory structures were created and persistence was implemented.
#### Dog Adoption website: A website for finding dogs that need a family, called “Adogtion”.
Dogs were categorized on the basis of breed, age and location. Used SQL to create and store the database. Back end scripting was done using PHP. The website has been designed using
HTML and Javascript.
#### Event Organizer: A virtual “to-do list” on which the user can add and delete tasks of varying priorities. The application will send reminders for upcoming tasks. The priority
queue is being implemented using C.#### Voice Recognition & Home Automation: Home automation was done using Arduino
Genuino Board. It was done on a model house made of cardboard. It involved the use of Google Voice Assistant API to perform actions such as switching lights on/off, opening a
door and watering plants. The same actions were also performed using sensors as well.
#### Wildlife Sanctuary Database Management System: A database for a wildlife sanctuary was created from scratch for this project. It had several entities such as animals, location,
location manager, employees and so on. Database queries were written using SQLite.
Interface with the front end was done using Flask.
#### Crime Activity Recognition and Safer Navigation: Created an app to recognize criminal activity in various parts of Bangalore and accordingly find the shortest and safest path from
point A to point B. Web scraped data from online news papers using BeautifulSoup.
● Created a Sudoku game (Sudoku Board generator) using Python.
● Created a Pokémon game using turbo C++ for project in class 12.",,,,,3.0,"● Interned at Cisco: Worked on a “Build Analytics” project. The aim was to analyze the build files and find out which repositories were taking a lot of time to get built. This data was then pumped to a tool where it could be used to pinpoint which part of the code was taking too long to build.
#### Interned at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore: Interned at Energy Research Institute at NTU (ERIAN) on a project in collaboration with Siemens as a Data Analytics intern. Mainly worked on collecting raw data from online resources using REST API and preprocessing the data to bring it to a usable format. These processes were done using various Python libraries such as pandas, requests, os and so on.
#### Interned at Microsoft Innovation Laboratory: Worked in a team of four on a project titled
“Wise Net”. We attempted to create a self aware network that would discover all the nodes in the network and create corresponding paths to transfer data through the network. We used RF modules (NRF24L01) to transfer the data from one node to the other, and transferred temperature data using temperature sensors. The neighbour discovery algorithm was
implemented using Arduino Uno boards. We hope to implement this network to analyse crowds in different areas.",,"C
